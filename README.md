Study Sound Mixer 🎵
Overview
The Study Sound Mixer is a lightweight web app designed to create the perfect study ambiance by mixing multiple relaxing sounds like rain, brown noise, lofi beats, and jazz. Instead of opening multiple YouTube tabs for background noise—which can quickly eat up your computer's RAM—this app lets you control and layer sounds all in one place, saving resources while providing a seamless experience.

Features
⚙️ Customizable Sound Mixing: Play and adjust the volume of rain, brown noise, lofi beats, and jazz.
📚 Task Management: Includes a built-in to-do list to help you stay productive and organized.
💨 Lightweight and Efficient: No need to juggle multiple resource-heavy tabs or apps; everything runs from your browser.

Why I made this
Opening multiple YouTube tabs for ambient sounds is convenient but comes at a cost: it can slow down your computer by using a lot of memory (RAM). The Study Sound Mixer solves this problem by providing a simple, efficient solution that lets you play and control multiple sounds without draining your system's performance.
